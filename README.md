Communication data are read from GPIO pins and then sent to Bluetooth server.

# 1. Theory

## 1.1. ESP32 development board
Development board is used for prototyping and testing ESP32 applications.
ESP32 is a system on a chip that integrates the following features:
- Wi-Fi (2.4 GHz band) and Bluetooth
- Dual high performance XtensaÂ® 32-bit LX6 CPU cores
- Ultra Low Power co-processor
- Multiple peripherals

## 1.2. Bluetooth
Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard for exchanging data between fixed and mobile devices over short distances using short-wavelength UHF radio waves in the industrial, scientific and medical radio bands, from 2.402 GHz to 2.480 GHz, and building personal area networks (PANs).

## 1.3. GPIO
General purpose input output (GPIO) pins are used for digital communication. GPIO pins can be configured as input or output pins. Input pins can be configured with pull-up or pull-down resistors. Output pins can be configured with high or low state.

## 1.4. PWM
Pulse width modulation (PWM) is a technique for getting analog results with digital means. PWM pins can be configured with frequency and resolution.

## 1.5. ADC
Analog to digital converter (ADC) is used for converting analog signal to digital signal.

## 1.6. UART
UART is a serial communication protocol that is used for communication between two devices. UART protocol is used for communication between ESP32 and VESC. UART protocol is used for communication between ESP32 and Bluetooth module.

## 1.7. VESC
VESC is an open source ESC (electronic speed controller) that can be used for controlling BLDC (brushless DC) motors.

## 1.8. CRC
Cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is an error-detecting code commonly used in digital networks and storage devices to detect accidental changes to raw data. Blocks of data entering these systems get a short check value attached, based on the remainder of a polynomial division of their contents. On retrieval, the calculation is repeated and, in the event the check values do not match, corrective action can be taken against data corruption. CRCs can be used for error correction.

# 2. Usage

## 2.1. Prerequisites

- Installed Arduino IDE with ESP32 board library
- Updated `config.h` file according to your hardware setup
- Installed VESC Tool
  - Configured VESC HW for UART communication with specified baudrate

- Front and rear lights (optional)
- Blueooth remote controller or mobile phone that uses application GlApp for controlling board

### Board setup

Configured VESC HW for UART communication needs to be connected to ESP32 UART1 pins.
For powering ESP32 development board is used VESC 5V output.
Boards lights should be connected to GPIO pins that support PWM. Pins are specified in `config.h` file.

### Controller setup

Controller requires ESP32 development board with wired joystick and buttons to GPIO pins specified in `config.h` file.
Buttons should be connected to vcc and GPIO pins with pull-down resistors.

## 2.3. Software

Program can be compiled and uploaded to ESP32 development board with Arduino IDE.
Because of problematic IDE, each program `.ino` has macro in header that must be defined before compiling and uploading program.
Commented macro in header disables other program `.ino` files from compiling and uploading and causing errors.

## 2.4. User interface

For controlling board, user can use remote control. 
After turning on controller with on/off switch, it automatically connects to board.
Bluetooth connection is indicated with blinking front light.
LED on both server and client ESP32 development board is enabled when Bluetooth connection is established.

### Accelerate / Brake joystick
- joystick up send accelerate values to board
- joystick down send brake values to board
- joystick center button can be used for switching direction of motor rotation

### Hold power button
- hold power button can lock current joystick values will keep sending them to board until hold power button is released

### Front light
- button press on controller toggles front light on/off
- front light blinks when Bluetooth client connects
- default light intensity is defined in `config.h` file

### Rear light
- button press on controller toggles rear light on/off
- rear light increases light intensity when brake is applied
- default light intensity is defined in `config.h` file

### Mode switch
- switch between modes of max current applied
- switch options are 50%, 100% and 200% of max current, which is defined in `config.h` file
- button press on controller increases current applied, in order 50% -> 100% -> 200% -> 50% -> ...

# 3. Implementation
